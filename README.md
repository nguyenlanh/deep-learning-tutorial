##A Tutorial on Deep Learning - Part 1:  Nonlinear Classi ers and The Backpropagation Algorithm

### Problems: 
The purpose of this exercise is for you to understand better the backpropagation algorithm and stochastic
gradient descent algorithm. In the following, I will create a dataset similar to the one in the tutorials and a
neural network of one hidden layer.
